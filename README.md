## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Odoo 17 Setup

Make sure you have Odoo 17 installed and configured. Your `odoo.conf` should include the path to your custom module:

```ini
addons_path = /path/to/odoo/addons, path/to/custom_addons

pyenv install 3.10.13
pyenv local 3.10.13
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### How to Run the App

Follow the steps below to run the **Fitness Tracking App** integrated with Odoo 17, including how to test and automate the data input process.

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mdue17/fitness_data_collector_odoo.git

```

### 2. Install Odoo 17
Follow the official Odoo 17 installation guide to set up the Odoo environment. If you need a quick start, you can use Odoo's Docker setup or install it directly on your machine.

for this App, run odoo with 
Ensure that Odoo is running and accessible on your local machine at http://localhost:8069.

### 3. Set Up the Custom Module in Odoo
After Odoo is installed, you‚Äôll need to install the custom module fitness_app:

 i. Copy the polar_fitness_tracker directory into your Odoo installation‚Äôs addons/ or custom_addons directory.
Example (replace with your Odoo path):

```
cp -r polar_fitness_tracker /path/to/your/odoo/addons/
```
ii. Restart Odoo to make the new module available:

```
  ./odoo-bin restart
```
iii. In Odoo, navigate to Apps, click Update App List, and search for Fitness App.

iv. Click Install to install the module

### 4. Once the odoo server is up and running...
Run the Python Client Scripts
There are two ways to run the application:

#### 1: Manually Enter Session Data
Use the workout_logger.py script to manually enter fitness session data and send it to Odoo.

```
  python external_clients/workout_logger.py
```
The script will prompt you for session data, such as:

- Session Name

- Average Heart Rate

- Calories Burned

- Duration (in minutes)

- Date of Birth

- Gender

After entering the data, it will be sent to Odoo through the API and stored in the fitness.session model.

#### 2.Running simulated_polar_client.py will do the same as above the prompts are prefilled and sent. 


#### 3. Automating the Process with a shell Script

To automate the data collection process, you can run both the workout_logger.py and polar_client.py scripts sequentially using the provided run_fitness_scripts.sh shell script.

##### i. Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x run_fitness_scripts.sh
```

##### ii. cd into proper folder & Run the script:
```
./run_fitness_scripts.sh
```
This will automatically run both Python scripts in sequence, with a short delay between them, to simulate continuous data logging.


#### 5. Testing the API
